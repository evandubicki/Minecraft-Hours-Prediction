    "This project uses two datasets from a Minecraft research server: players.csv and sessions.csv.

Below is a concise summary of all variables.\n",

These variables allow me to explore whether certain types of players tend to accumulate more hours overall. By wrangling the players data and keeping it in a tidy format, I can directly compare these predictors and prepare the dataset for modeling later in the project.\n"
